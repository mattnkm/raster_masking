# raster_masking
This repository contains the code to create raster-masks based on Brunei. GeoTIFF files are too large to be uploaded. A HTML file of the code is provided. There is more to be added in this repo with regards to the additional masking on other areas, in addition to the validation of the model. Currently, the author is currently working on this.
